##task

The task is to manipulate some raster data and produce some descriptive statistics. Climatic models fed into the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the models are divided into Shared Socioeconomic Pathways known as SSPs, ranging from SSP1 (lots of mitigation and adaption) to SSP5 (fossil fuel development). The Carbon Brief explainer has more information on the scenarios.

For any country in the World produce descriptive statistics that show the difference in maximum temperature for key cities between SSP1 and SSP5 for the years 2081-2100, using any model and resolution.

## data input

### load packages
```{r}
library(sf)
library(here)
library(janitor)
library(tidyverse)
library(terra)
library(ggplot2)
```

### read in data
```{r}
spain <- sf::st_read(here("3_2_hmwk3_data", "gadm41_ESP.gpkg"),
                      layer='ADM_ADM_0')

layers <- st_layers(here("3_2_hmwk3_data", "gadm41_ESP.gpkg"))

world_cities <- sf::st_read(here("3_2_hmwk3_data", "World_Cities", "World_Cities.shp"))

ssp1 <-terra::rast(here("3_2_hmwk3_data", "wc2.1_2.5m_tmax_ACCESS-CM2_ssp126_2081-2100.tif"))

ssp1_mean <- mean(ssp1)

ssp5 <-terra::rast(here("3_2_hmwk3_data", "wc2.1_2.5m_tmax_ACCESS-CM2_ssp585_2081-2100.tif"))
```
## data preparation

### filter the cities
```{r}
spanish_cities <- world_cities %>%
  janitor::clean_names(.)%>%
  dplyr::filter(cntry_name=="Spain")


#ssp_diff <- ssp5-ssp1
```

### crop and mask rasters
```{r}
####ssp1

spain_diff <- ssp1 %>%
  # now crop our temp data to the extent
  terra::crop(.,spain)

exact_spain <- spain_diff %>%
  terra::mask(.,spain)

###ssp5

spain_diff5 <- ssp5 %>%
  # now crop our temp data to the extent
  terra::crop(.,spain)

exact_spain5 <- spain_diff5 %>%
  terra::mask(.,spain)

```

### subtract rasters
```{r}
#### sub
diff_climate_model <- exact_spain5 - exact_spain 
```

### rename and extract data from points
```{r}
month <- c("Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", 
           "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec")

names(diff_climate_model) <- month

spain_city_diff<- terra::extract(diff_climate_model, spanish_cities)
```

## join the data

### make a join ID column in the original point sf to join the extracted data back to the point dataset
```{r}
spanish_cities_join_ID <- spanish_cities %>%
  dplyr::mutate(join_id= 1:n())
```

### join extracted data to spanish cities
```{r}
spain_city_diff2 <- spanish_cities_join_ID%>%
  dplyr::left_join(.,
            spain_city_diff,
             by = c("join_id" = "ID"))
```

## plot the data

### drop the geometry and make a facet plot of differences per month
```{r}
# all cities in spain where there is data

city_climate_diff <- spain_city_diff2 %>%
  dplyr::select(c(,16:27))%>%
  sf::st_drop_geometry(.)%>%
  dplyr::as_tibble()

tidy_city_diff <- city_climate_diff %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(everything(), 
               names_to="Months", 
               values_to="temp_diff")

facet_plot <- tidy_city_diff %>%
  dplyr::mutate(Months = factor(Months, levels = c("Jan","Feb","Mar",
                                            "Apr","May","Jun",
                                            "Jul","Aug","Sep",
                                            "Oct","Nov","Dec")))
# Plot faceted histogram
plot<-ggplot(facet_plot, aes(x=temp_diff, na.rm=TRUE))+
  geom_histogram(color="black", binwidth = .1)+
  labs(title="Ggplot2 faceted difference in climate scenarios of max temp", 
       x="Temperature",
       y="Frequency")+
  facet_grid(Months ~ .)+
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))

```
## extra analysis

### taking each climate scenario and plotting the distribution of max temp values for Spanish cities
```{r}
